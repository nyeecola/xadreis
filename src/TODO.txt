- if a move would put the player in check, remove it from the legal moves list
  - `make_move` is implemented, use it alongside `is_in_check` and `generate_attacks`
  	to check if the move would put the player in check and, if so, rollback the move,
  	perhaps this can be easily accomplished by just passing game_state as a copy when
  	making the move temporarily.
